My dank personal website!

## Website
The website itself is very simple. At the very top it contains some simple ASCII art and links to my other social media profiles (Twitter, GitHub and YouTube). For now, the rest of the page is taken up by an Arch Linux copypasta. The image below is a screenshot of the website:

## Design
The site is quite minimal, as it only contains some text and a few hyperlinks. The body itself is 640 pixels wide and centered accordingly. The font used is called Fira Code and matches the rest of my system. The dark color scheme used is called Gruvbox.
